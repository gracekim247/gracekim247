# 👋 Hi, I'm Grace!

🎓 I'm a Computer Science student at Queens College (CUNY), graduating Spring 2026.  
💻 Software Engineer Intern @ Krida (FinTech x AI startup)  
🧠 2025–26 Break Through Tech AI Fellow @ Cornell Tech  
🌟 Passionate about empowering small businesses & building tech for good |📍 Based in New York 

I love building real-world solutions, whether it's automating my family’s laundromat order pipeline or delivering interactive crime-risk heatmaps across NYC. I'm big on initiative, growth, and using tech to make lives easier (especially for small business owners!).

Right now, I’m exploring AI model deployment, backend system design, and frontend accessibility. Got a cool opportunity or mentorship lead? I’d love to hear from you!
